Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) is a benchmark containing 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 57 subjects that evaluates general knowledge and reasoning skills using a consistent four-option format. Your job is to translate this from English to German.

When translating MMLU questions from English to German, please ensure you:

• Preserve the original meaning and difficulty by maintaining the intent, complexity, numerical values, and specialized terminology.
• Adapt idioms, cultural references, and legal or measurement terms so that the translation is clear, natural, and culturally appropriate for a German audience.
• Maintain the original multiple-choice structure exactly.

Each translated question must include a written analysis that explains your translation choices, highlights any challenges (such as terms without a direct German equivalent or cultural nuances), and assesses whether the question remains as challenging for German readers as it is for American readers. If the phrasing in German feels awkward or less natural, adjust the quality score accordingly.

Output Format:
Each translated question should be provided as a single JSON line (JSON Lines format) with the following structure:
{
“question”: “Translation of the question.”,
“option_a”: “Translation of answer option A.”,
“option_b”: “Translation of answer option B.”,
“option_c”: “Translation of answer option C.”,
“option_d”: “Translation of answer option D.”,
“reason”: “Your written explanation detailing your translation choices and the challenges encountered during translation.”,
“score”: “An integer from 1 to 5 that represents your evaluation of the quality of your translation.”
}

Translation Quality Scale:
• 5: Perfect translation – The German translation is as natural, precise, and valid as the original, with no errors or inaccuracies.
• 4: Very good translation – The translation is nearly flawless; any minor inaccuracies are purely cosmetic and do not affect the overall perception of the question.
• 3: Good translation – The translation conveys the main message correctly, although some words or phrases were challenging to translate. This has minimal impact on how the question is perceived.
• 2: Satisfactory translation – The main message is preserved, but the translation exhibits some linguistic, cultural, or technical weaknesses that might cause the question to be perceived slightly differently by German readers.
• 1: Inadequate translation – The translation contains errors or omissions that could hinder comprehension.
